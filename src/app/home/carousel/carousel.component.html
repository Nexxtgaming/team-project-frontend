          <h1>Who are we?</h1>
          <p>We are a group of students from the Łódź University of Technology, and we are working on a project on the
            topic
            of Hybrid Warfare. As this subject can covers a lot of categories, we choose to focus on a way to help
            refugees
            and asylum seekers to find a way to survive in the world in the current situation. We decided to use a web
            application to help those people, and you just landed on it. We hope it provides all the help you need, and
            that
            it can manage to keep you safe.</p>

          <h1>What's different?</h1>
          <p>Basically, we thought that the existing solution were not complete enough to help refugees as much as
            possible.
            We wanted to make something that would gather every information
            you might need, in a quick and efficient way, but we also wanted to allow everyone to feel safe when looking
            but
            also when providing help. Nobody will be able to see your informations
            unless they are logged in and verified, and for each offer you'll be able to see the user rating based on
            other
            people's review, so that you can decide if you find someone trustworthy.</p></div>
