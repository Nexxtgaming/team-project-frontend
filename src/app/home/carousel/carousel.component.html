          <h1>What's different?</h1>
          <p>Basically, we thought that the existing solution were not complete enough to help refugees as much as
            possible.
            We wanted to make something that would gather every information
            you might need, in a quick and efficient way, but we also wanted to allow everyone to feel safe when looking
            but
            also when providing help. Nobody will be able to see your informations
            unless they are logged in and verified, and for each offer you'll be able to see the user rating based on
            other
            people's review, so that you can decide if you find someone trustworthy.</p></div>
